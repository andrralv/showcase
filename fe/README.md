# How to play

When you run the project you are presented with 12 tiles indicating 12 different cities in the world.  You have 3 attempts to guess which city that has a hidden prize (a trip to that destination - a blatant lie).   
When you correctly guess the city you also have to select which country that city belongs to, and then you can claim the prize (also a lie, you get redirected to a Youtube search of that city).
